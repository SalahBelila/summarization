# How To Use The Model

Everything you need to know is included in the tutorial.ipynb file.
To start training, you can simply run all the cells in the tutorial notebook. However, if you want to use pre-trained embedding you need to download the embedding files manually from: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. Extract the files and put them in the glove directory, also bear in mind that only glove.6b is supported.
